# Usage

django-jp-birthday provides a `jp_birthday.models.BirthdayModel` model type which is a subclass of django.db.models.Model and thus has the same characteristics as that.

`jp_birthday.managers.JpBirthdayManager` is used as a manager for `jp_birthday.models.BirthdayModel` and provides various methods.

```Python
from jp_birthday.models import BirthdayModel

class ModelsTest(BirthdayModel):

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'jp_birthday'
        ordering = ('pk',)
```

## Get all user profiles within the next 30 days

```Python
# ["2001-01-01", "2000-01-02", "2002-12-31"]

jan1 = date(year=2010, month=1, day=1)
birthdays = ModelsTest.objects.get_upcoming_birthdays(after=jan1)
# ["2001-01-01", "2000-01-02"]
```

## Get all user profiles which have their birthday today

```Python
# ["2001-01-01", "2000-01-02", "2002-12-31", "1990-03-01"]

jan1 = date(year=2010, month=1, day=1)

# ["2001-01-01", "1990-01-01"]
```

# ["2001-01-01", "2000-01-02", "2002-12-31", "1990-03-01"]
